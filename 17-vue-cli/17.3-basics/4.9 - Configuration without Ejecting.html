    <h3>Configuration without Ejecting</h3>
    <p>Projects created via <code>vue create</code> are ready to go without the need for additional configuration. The plugins are designed to work with one another so in most cases, all you need to do is pick the features you want during the interactive prompts.</p>
    <p>However, we also understand that it's impossible to cater to every possible need, and the needs of a project may also change over time. Projects created by Vue CLI allow you to configure almost every aspect of the tooling without ever needing to eject. Check out the <a href="https://cli.vuejs.org/config/" class="">Config Reference</a> for more details.</p>
