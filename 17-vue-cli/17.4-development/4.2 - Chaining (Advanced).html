    <h3>Chaining (Advanced)</h3>
    <p>The internal webpack config is maintained using <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-neutrino/webpack-chain"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">webpack-chain</a>. The library provides an abstraction over the
        raw webpack config, with the ability to define named loader rules and named plugins, and later "tap" into those
        rules and modify their options.</p>
    <p>This allows us finer-grained control over the internal config. Below you will see some examples of common
        modifications done via the <code>chainWebpack</code> option in <code>vue.config.js</code>.</p>
    <p>TIP</p>
    <p><a href="https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/webpack.html#inspecting-the-project-s-webpack-config">vue inspect</a> will
        be extremely helpful when you are trying to access specific loaders via chaining.</p>
