    <h3>Using Resolved Config as a File</h3>
    <p>Some external tools may need access to the resolved webpack config as a file, for example IDEs or command line
        tools that expect a webpack config path. In that case you can use the following path:</p>
    <pre>
        &lt;projectRoot&gt;/node_modules/@vue/cli-service/webpack.config.js
    </pre>
    <p>This file dynamically resolves and exports the exact same webpack config used in <code>vue-cli-service</code>
        commands, including those from plugins and even your custom configurations.</p>
