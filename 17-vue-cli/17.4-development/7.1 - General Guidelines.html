    <h2><a href="https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/deployment.html#general-guidelines">#</a> General Guidelines</h2>
    <p>If you are using Vue CLI along with a backend framework that handles static assets as part of its deployment, all
        you need to do is make sure Vue CLI generates the built files in the correct location, and then follow the
        deployment instruction of your backend framework.</p>
    <p>If you are developing your frontend app separately from your backend - i.e. your backend exposes an API for your
        frontend to talk to, then your frontend is essentially a purely static app. You can deploy the built content in
        the <code>dist</code> directory to any static file server, but make sure to set the correct <a
            href="https://cli.vuejs.org/config/#publicpath">publicPath</a>.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/deployment.html#previewing-locally">#</a> Previewing Locally</h3>
    <p>The <code>dist</code> directory is meant to be served by an HTTP server (unless you've configured
        <code>publicPath</code> to be a relative value), so it will not work if you open <code>dist/index.html</code>
        directly over <code>file://</code> protocol. The easiest way to preview your production build locally is using a
        Node.js static file server, for example <a href="https://github.com/zeit/serve" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">serve</a>:</p>
    <pre>
        npm install -g serve
        # -s flag means serve it in Single-Page Application mode
        # which deals with the routing problem below
        serve -s dist
    </pre>

    <h3><a href="https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/deployment.html#routing-with-history-pushstate">#</a> Routing with <code>history.pushState</code></h3>
    <p>If you are using Vue Router in <code>history</code> mode, a simple static file server will fail. For example, if
        you used Vue Router with a route for <code>/todos/42</code>, the dev server has been configured to respond to
        <code>localhost:3000/todos/42</code> properly, but a simple static server serving a production build will
        respond with a 404 instead.</p>
    <p>To fix that, you will need to configure your production server to fallback to <code>index.html</code> for any
        requests that do not match a static file. The Vue Router docs provides <a
            href="https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/history-mode.html" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">configuration instructions for common server setups</a>.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/deployment.html#cors">#</a> CORS</h3>
    <p>If your static frontend is deployed to a different domain from your backend API, you will need to properly
        configure <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">CORS</a>.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/deployment.html#pwa">#</a> PWA</h3>
    <p>If you are using the PWA plugin, your app must be served over HTTPS so that <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">Service Worker</a> can be properly registered.</p>
