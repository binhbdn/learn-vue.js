    <h3>Environment Variables</h3>

    <h4>Local Only Variables</h4>
    <p>Sometimes you might have env variables that should not be committed into the codebase, especially if your project
        is hosted in a public repository. In that case you should use an <code>.env.local</code> file instead. Local env
        files are ignored in <code>.gitignore</code> by default.</p>
    <p><code>.local</code> can also be appended to mode-specific env files, for example
        <code>.env.development.local</code> will be loaded during development, and is ignored by git.</p>
