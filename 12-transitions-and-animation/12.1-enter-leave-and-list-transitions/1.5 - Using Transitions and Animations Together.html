    <h2>Using Transitions and Animations Together</h2>
    <p>Vue needs to attach event listeners in order to know when a transition has ended. It can either be <code>transitionend</code> or <code>animationend</code>, depending on the type of CSS rules applied. If you are only using one or the other, Vue can automatically detect the correct type.</p>
    <p>However, in some cases you may want to have both on the same element, for example having a CSS animation triggered by Vue, along with a CSS transition effect on hover. In these cases, you will have to explicitly declare the type you want Vue to care about in a <code>type</code> attribute, with a value of either <code>animation</code> or <code>transition</code>.</p>
