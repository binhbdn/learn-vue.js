    <h1>State Transitions</h1>
    <p>Vue’s transition system offers many simple ways to animate entering, leaving, and lists, but what about animating your data itself? For example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>numbers and calculations</li>
        <li>colors displayed</li>
        <li>the positions of SVG nodes</li>
        <li>the sizes and other properties of elements</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All of these are either already stored as raw numbers or can be converted into numbers. Once we do that, we can animate these state changes using 3rd-party libraries to tween state, in combination with Vue’s reactivity and component systems.</p>
