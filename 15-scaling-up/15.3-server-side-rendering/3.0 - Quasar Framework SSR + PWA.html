    <h2>Quasar Framework SSR + PWA / Bản hướng dẫn SSR hoàn chỉnh</h2>
    <p><a href="https://quasar.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quasar Framework</a> will generate an SSR app (with optional PWA handoff) that leverages its best-in-class build system, sensible configuration and developer extensibility to make designing and building your idea a breeze. With over one hundred specific “Material Design 2.0”-compliant components, you can decide which ones to execute on the server, which are available in the browser - and even manage the <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tags of your site. Quasar is a node.js and webpack based development environment that supercharges and streamlines rapid development of SPA, PWA, SSR, Electron, Capacitor and Cordova apps - all from one codebase.</p>
