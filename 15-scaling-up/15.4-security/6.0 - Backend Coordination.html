    <h1>Security</h1>
    <h2>Backend Coordination</h2>
    <p>HTTP security vulnerabilities, such as cross-site request forgery (CSRF/XSRF) and cross-site script inclusion (XSSI), are primarily addressed on the backend, so aren’t a concern of Vue’s. However, it’s still a good idea to communicate with your backend team to learn how to best interact with their API, e.g. by submitting CSRF tokens with form submissions.</p>
