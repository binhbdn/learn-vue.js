    <h1>Security</h1>
    <h2>Potential Dangers</h2>
    <p>In any web application, allowing unsanitized, user-provided content to be executed as HTML, CSS, or JavaScript is potentially dangerous, so should be avoided wherever possible. There are times when some risk be acceptable though.</p>
    <p>For example, services like CodePen and JSFiddle allow user-provided content to be executed, but it’s in a context where this is expected and sandboxed to some extent inside iframes. In the cases when an important feature inherently requires some level of vulnerability, it’s up to your team to weigh the importance of the feature against the worst-case scenarios the vulnerability enables.</p>
