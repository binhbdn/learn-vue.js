    <h1>Security</h1>
    <h2>Potential Dangers</h2>
    <p>We strongly discourage ever rendering a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element with Vue, since templates and render functions should never have side effects. However, this isn’t the only way to include strings that would be evaluated as JavaScript at runtime.</p>
    <p>Every HTML element has attributes with values accepting strings of JavaScript, such as <code>onclick</code>, <code>onfocus</code>, and <code>onmouseenter</code>. Binding user-provided JavaScript to any of these event attributes is a potential security risk, so should be avoided.</p>
    <p class="tip">Note that user-provided JavaScript can never be considered 100% safe unless it’s in a sandboxed iframe or in a part of the app where only the user who wrote that JavaScript can ever be exposed to it.</p>
    <p>Sometimes we receive vulnerability reports on how it’s possible to do cross-site scripting (XSS) in Vue templates. In general, we do not consider such cases to be actual vulnerabilities, because there’s no practical way to protect developers from the two scenarios that would allow XSS:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><p>The developer is explicitly asking Vue to render user-provided, unsanitized content as Vue templates. This is inherently unsafe and there’s no way for Vue to know the origin.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>The developer is mounting Vue to an entire HTML page which happens to contain server-rendered and user-provided content. This is fundamentally the same problem as #1, but sometimes devs may do it without realizing. This can lead to possible vulnerabilities where the attacker provides HTML which is safe as plain HTML but unsafe as a Vue template. The best practice is to never mount Vue on nodes that may contain server-rendered and user-provided content.</p>
