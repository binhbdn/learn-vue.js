    <h2>Potential Dangers</h2>

    <h3 id="Injecting-URLs"><a href="#Injecting-URLs" class="headerlink" title="Injecting URLs" data-scroll="">Injecting URLs</a></h3>
    <p>In a URL like this:</p>
    <pre>
        &lt;a v-bind:href="userProvidedUrl"&gt;
            click me
        &lt;/a&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>There’s a potential security issue if the URL has not been “sanitized” to prevent JavaScript execution using <code>javascript:</code>. There are libraries such as <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@braintree/sanitize-url" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sanitize-url</a> to help with this, but note:</p>
    <p class="tip">If you’re ever doing URL sanitization on the frontend, you already have a security issue. User-provided URLs should always be sanitized by your backend before even being saved to a database. Then the problem is avoided for <em>every</em> client connecting to your API, including native mobile apps. Also note that even with sanitized URLs, Vue cannot help you guarantee that they lead to safe destinations.</p>
