    <h1>Navigation Guards</h1>
    <h2>Global Resolve Guards</h2>
    <p>You can register a global guard with <code>router.beforeResolve</code>. This is similar to <code>router.beforeEach</code>, with the difference that resolve guards will be called right before the navigation is confirmed, <strong>after all in-component guards and async route components are resolved</strong>.</p>
