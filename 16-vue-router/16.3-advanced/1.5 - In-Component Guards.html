    <h1>Navigation Guards</h1>
    <h2>In-Component Guards</h2>
    <p>Finally, you can directly define route navigation guards inside route components (the ones passed to the router configuration) with the following options:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>beforeRouteEnter</code></li>
        <li><code>beforeRouteUpdate</code></li>
        <li><code>beforeRouteLeave</code></li>
    </ul>
    <pre>
        const Foo = {
            template: `...`,
            beforeRouteEnter(to, from, next) {
                // called before the route that renders this component is confirmed.
                // does NOT have access to `this` component instance,
                // because it has not been created yet when this guard is called!
            },
            beforeRouteUpdate(to, from, next) {
                // called when the route that renders this component has changed.
                // This component being reused (by using an explicit `key`) in the new route or not doesn't change anything.
                // For example, for a route with dynamic params `/foo/:id`, when we
                // navigate between `/foo/1` and `/foo/2`, the same `Foo` component instance
                // will be reused (unless you provided a `key` to `&lt;router-view&gt;`), and this hook will be called when that happens.
                // has access to `this` component instance.
            },
            beforeRouteLeave(to, from, next) {
                // called when the route that renders this component is about to
                // be navigated away from.
                // has access to `this` component instance.
            }
          }
    </pre>
    <p>The <code>beforeRouteEnter</code> guard does <strong>NOT</strong> have access to <code>this</code>, because the guard is called before the navigation is confirmed, thus the new entering component has not even been created yet.</p>
    <p>However, you can access the instance by passing a callback to <code>next</code>. The callback will be called when the navigation is confirmed, and the component instance will be passed to the callback as the argument:</p>
    <pre>
        beforeRouteEnter (to, from, next) {
            next(vm =&gt; {
                // access to component instance via `vm`
            })
        }
    </pre>
    <p>Note that <code>beforeRouteEnter</code> is the only guard that supports passing a callback to <code>next</code>. For <code>beforeRouteUpdate</code> and <code>beforeRouteLeave</code>, <code>this</code> is already available, so passing a callback is unnecessary and therefore <em>not supported</em>:</p>
    <pre>
        beforeRouteUpdate (to, from, next) {
            // just use `this`
            this.name = to.params.name
            next()
        }
    </pre>
    <p>The <strong>leave guard</strong> is usually used to prevent the user from accidentally leaving the route with unsaved edits. The navigation can be canceled by calling <code>next(false)</code>.</p>
    <pre>
        beforeRouteLeave (to, from, next) {
            const answer = window.confirm('Do you really want to leave? you have unsaved changes!')
            if (answer) {
                next()
            } else {
                next(false)
            }
        }
    </pre>
    <p>If you are using mixins that add in-component navigation guards, make sure to add the mixin <strong>after installing the router plugin</strong>:</p>
    <pre>
        Vue.use(Router)

        Vue.mixin({
            beforeRouteUpdate(to, from, next) {
                // ...
            }
        })
    </pre>
