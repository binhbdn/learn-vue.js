    <h1>Route Meta Fields</h1>
    <p>Sometimes, you might want to attach arbitrary information to routes like transition names, who can access the route, etc. This can be achieved through the <code>meta</code> property which accepts an object of properties and can be accessed on the route location and navigation guards. You can define <code>meta</code> properties like this:</p>
    <pre>
        const router = new VueRouter({
            routes: [
              {
                path: '/foo',
                component: Foo,
                children: [
                  {
                    path: 'bar',
                    component: Bar,
                    // a meta field
                    meta: { requiresAuth: true }
                  }
                ]
              }
            ]
        })
    </pre>
    <p>So how do we access this <code>meta</code> field?</p>
    <p>First, each route object in the <code>routes</code> configuration is called a <strong>route record</strong>. Route records may be nested. Therefore when a route is matched, it can potentially match more than one route record.</p>
    <p>For example, with the above route config, the URL <code>/foo/bar</code> will match both the parent route record and the child route record.</p>
    <p>All route records matched by a route are exposed on the <code>$route</code> object (and also route objects in navigation guards) as the <code>$route.matched</code> Array. Therefore, we will need to iterate over <code>$route.matched</code> to check for meta fields in route records.</p>
    <p>An example use case is checking for a meta field in the global navigation guard:</p>
    <pre>
        router.beforeEach((to, from, next) =&gt; {
            if (to.matched.some(record =&gt; record.meta.requiresAuth)) {
                // this route requires auth, check if logged in
                // if not, redirect to login page.
                if (!auth.loggedIn()) {
                    next({
                    path: '/login',
                    query: { redirect: to.fullPath }
                    })
                } else {
                    next()
                }
            } else {
              next() // make sure to always call next()!
            }
        })
    </pre>
