    <h1>Navigation Failures</h1>
    <h2>NavigationFailureType</h2>
    <p><code>NavigationFailureType</code> help developers to differentiate between the various types of <em>Navigation Failures</em>. There are four different types:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>redirected</code>: <code>next(newLocation)</code> was called inside of a navigation guard to redirect somewhere else.</li>
        <li><code>aborted</code>: <code>next(false)</code> was called inside of a navigation guard to the navigation.</li>
        <li><code>cancelled</code>: A new navigation completely took place before the current navigation could finish. e.g. <code>router.push</code> was called while waiting inside of a navigation guard.</li>
        <li><code>duplicated</code>: The navigation was prevented because we are already at the target location.</li>
    </ul>
