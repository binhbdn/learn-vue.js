    <h1>Controlling Updates</h1>
    <p>Thanks to Vue’s Reactivity system, it always knows when to update (if you use it correctly). There are edge cases, however, when you might want to force an update, despite the fact that no reactive data has changed. Then there are other cases when you might want to prevent unnecessary updates.</p>
    
    <h2>5.1 - Forcing an Update</h2>
    <p class="tip">If you find yourself needing to force an update in Vue, in 99.99% of cases, you’ve made a mistake somewhere.</p>
    <p>You may not have accounted for change detection caveats <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/list.html#Caveats">with arrays</a> or <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/list.html#Object-Change-Detection-Caveats">objects</a>, or you may be relying on state that isn’t tracked by Vue’s reactivity system, e.g. with <code>data</code>.</p>
    <p>However, if you’ve ruled out the above and find yourself in this extremely rare situation of having to manually force an update, you can do so with <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#vm-forceUpdate"><code>$forceUpdate</code></a>.</p>
