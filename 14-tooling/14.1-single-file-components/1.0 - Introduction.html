    <h1>Single File Components</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In many Vue projects, global components will be defined using <code>Vue.component</code>, followed by <code>new Vue({ el: '#container' })</code> to target a container element in the body of every page.</p>
    <p>This can work very well for small to medium-sized projects, where JavaScript is only used to enhance certain views. In more complex projects however, or when your frontend is entirely driven by JavaScript, these disadvantages become apparent:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Global definitions</strong> force unique names for every component</li>
        <li><strong>String templates</strong> lack syntax highlighting and require ugly slashes for multiline HTML</li>
        <li><strong>No CSS support</strong> means that while HTML and JavaScript are modularized into components, CSS is conspicuously left out</li>
        <li><strong>No build step</strong> restricts us to HTML and ES5 JavaScript, rather than preprocessors like Pug (formerly Jade) and Babel</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All of these are solved by <strong>single-file components</strong> with a <code>.vue</code> extension, made possible with build tools such as Webpack or Browserify.</p>
    <p>Here’s an example of a file we’ll call <code>Hello.vue</code>:</p>

    <p>Now we get:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/vuejs/awesome-vue#source-code-editing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Complete syntax highlighting</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://webpack.js.org/concepts/modules/#what-is-a-webpack-module" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CommonJS modules</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/en/features/scoped-css.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Component-scoped CSS</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>As promised, we can also use preprocessors such as Pug, Babel (with ES2015 modules), and Stylus for cleaner and more feature-rich components.</p>

    <p>These specific languages are only examples. You could as easily use Bublé, TypeScript, SCSS, PostCSS - or whatever other preprocessors that help you be productive. If using Webpack with <code>vue-loader</code>, it also has first-class support for CSS Modules.</p>
