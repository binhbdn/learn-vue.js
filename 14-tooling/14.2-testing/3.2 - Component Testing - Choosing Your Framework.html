    <h1>Component Testing</h1>
    <h2>Choosing Your Framework</h2>
    <p>The following section provides guidelines on things to keep in mind when evaluating which component testing framework is best for your application.</p>

    <p>It should be no surprise that one of the first criteria is that a component testing library should have is being as compatible with the Vue ecosystem as possible. While this may seem comprehensive, some key integration areas to keep in mind include single file components (SFCs), Vuex, Vue Router, and any other Vue specific plugins that your application relies on.</p>

    <p>When tests fail, it is critical that your component testing framework provides useful error logs that help to minimize the amount of time it takes to debug the problem. In addition to simply telling you what test fails, they should also provide context for why a test fails, e.g., what is expected vs what was received.</p>
