    <h1>Testing</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>When it comes to building reliable applications, tests can play a critical role in an individual or teamâ€™s ability to build new features, refactor code, fix bugs, etc. While there are many schools of thought with testing, there are three categories often discussed in the context of web applications:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Unit Testing</li>
        <li>Component Testing</li>
        <li>End-To-End (E2E) Testing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This section aims to provide guidance to navigating the testing ecosystem and choosing the right tools for your Vue application or component library.</p>
