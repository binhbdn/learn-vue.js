    <h1>Component Testing</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>To test most Vue components, they must be mounted to the DOM (either virtual or real) in order to fully assert that they are working. This is another framework-agnostic concept. As a result, component testing frameworks were created to give users the ability to do this reliably while also providing Vue-specific conveniences such as integrations for Vuex, Vue Router, and other Vue plugins.</p>
