    <h1>Unit Testing</h1>
    <h2>Choosing Your Framework</h2>
    <p>Since unit testing advice is often framework-agnostic, here are some basic guidelines to keep in mind when evaluating which unit testing tool is best for your application.</p>
    
    <h3 id="First-class-error-reporting"><a href="#First-class-error-reporting" class="headerlink" title="First-class error reporting"></a>First-class error reporting</h3>
    <p>When tests fail, it is critical that your unit testing framework provides useful errors. This is the job of the assertion library. An assertion with high-quality error messages helps minimize the amount of time it takes to debug the problem. In addition to simply telling you what test is failing, assertion libraries provide context for why a test fails, e.g., what is expected vs what was received.</p>
    <p>Some unit testing frameworks, like Jest, include assertion libraries. Others, like Mocha, require you to install assertion libraries separately (usually Chai).</p>

    <h3 id="Active-community-and-team"><a href="#Active-community-and-team" class="headerlink" title="Active community and team"></a>Active community and team</h3>
    <p>Since the majority of unit testing frameworks are open-source, having a community that is active can be critical to some teams that will be maintaining their tests for a long period of time and needs to ensure that a project will be actively maintained. In addition, having an active community has the benefit of providing more support whenever you run into issues.</p>
