    <h1>Unit Testing</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Unit tests allow you to test individual units of code in isolation. The purpose of unit testing is to provide developers with confidence in their code. By writing thorough, meaningful tests, you achieve the confidence that as new features are built or your code is refactored your application will remain functional and stable.</p>
    <p>Unit testing a Vue application does not significantly differ from testing other types of applications.</p>
