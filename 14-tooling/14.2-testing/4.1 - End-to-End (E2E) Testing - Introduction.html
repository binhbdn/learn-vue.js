    <h1>End-to-End (E2E) Testing</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>While unit tests provide developers with some degree of confidence, unit and component tests are limited in their abilities to provide holistic coverage of an application when deployed to production. As a result, end-to-end (E2E) tests provide coverage on what is arguably the most important aspect of an application: what happens when users actually use your applications.</p>
    <p>In other words, E2E tests validate all of the layers in your application. This not only includes your frontend code, but all associated backend services and infrastructure that are more representative of the environment that your users will be in. By testing how user actions impact your application, E2E tests are often the key to higher confidence in whether an application is functioning properly or not.</p>
